Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with REST Assured.

`Karate Service Demo` makes a call to a very simple service. The service
that is being tested is running on port `8888` on `ip-172-24-63-138.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal`. The tests make use of a
preprocessor to modify the request so that it appears to have been sent to
`http://ip-172-24-63-138.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal`. If your service includes URIs in its responses, for example
because it uses hypermedia, similar preprocessing can be applied to the response before
it is documented.

Three snippets are produced. One showing how to make a request using cURL:
